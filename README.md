Repository for code and a subset of data for chapter 1 of my dissertation.

These data are collected from an experiment conducted on Egmont Key (Florida, off the coast of Pinellas county) to test the effects of gopher tortoise herbivory on several aspects plant communities. Three treatments were established- 1) A fenced plot excluding gopher tortoises from feeding, 2) A fenced (open on two sides) control where tortoises are able to freely feed, and 3) and control which did not include any fencing. Five replicates were established for each treatment.

R scripts provide code fore summarising number of individual plants, species richness, Gini-Simpsons diversity, species dominance, and species evenness seasonally for a period of two years across the study. 

Additional scripts model and plot these data.
